# Deployment Log - October 6, 2025

## Summary
Complete platform redesign and deployment to cloud (Netlify + Streamlit Cloud) with bilingual support, RSS-based news collection, and fixed dashboard functionality.

---

## 1. CLOUD DEPLOYMENT SETUP

### Architecture
```
nepal-digital-platform.netlify.app (Landing + Static Pages)
├── index.html - Main landing page
├── about.html - About/Vision page
├── office-tracker-v2.html - Government services
└── political_game/ - Political education game

nepal-digital-platform-eigk8niuix62swmacygrif.streamlit.app
└── news_aggregator/nepal_dashboard.py - News intelligence dashboard
```

### Deployment Fixes

#### Netlify Deployment Issues
**Problem**: Netlify kept failing with Python dependency errors
- Error: "Failed during stage 'Install dependencies': dependency_installation script returned non-zero exit code: 1"
- Root cause: Netlify detected `requirements.txt` at root and tried to install Python packages

**Solution**:
1. Moved all Python files to `news_aggregator/` folder:
   - `.python-version`
   - `requirements.txt`
   - `requirements-streamlit.txt`
   - `requirements-test.txt`
   - `runtime.txt`

2. Created `netlify.toml`:
```toml
[build]
  command = "echo 'No build required'"
  publish = "."

[build.environment]
  PYTHON_VERSION = ""
```

3. Result: ✅ Netlify now deploys successfully as static site

#### Streamlit Cloud Deployment Issues

**Problem 1**: Database too large for Git (6.9MB)
**Solution**: Reduced database to 1MB by keeping only last 7 days of articles, then implemented auto-collection on first run

**Problem 2**: Missing logs directory
**Error**: `FileNotFoundError: '/mount/src/nepal-digital-platform/news_aggregator/logs/twitter_integration.log'`
**Solution**: Added `os.makedirs(log_dir, exist_ok=True)` in `twitter_integration.py:31-35`

**Problem 3**: Streamlit 1.50 API changes
**Error**: `TypeError: 'str' object cannot be interpreted as an integer` for `width='stretch'`
**Solution**: Replaced all `width='stretch'` with `use_container_width=True` (10 occurrences)

**Problem 4**: Python 3.13 compatibility
**Error**: wordcloud and numpy incompatible with Python 3.13
**Solution**: Added `.python-version` file with `3.11`

## 2. PLATFORM REDESIGN

### Design Changes

#### Removed
- ❌ "नागरिकता" (citizenship) branding - not a citizenship platform
- ❌ "Intelligence" terminology - too heavy/overselling
- ❌ "ट्र्याकर" (tracker) - rendering issues in Devanagari

#### New Branding
- ✅ **Header**: "नेपाल डिजिटल मञ्च" (Nepal Digital Platform)
- ✅ **Tagline**: "सूचना र शिक्षाको लागि डिजिटल उपकरणहरू" (Digital Tools for Information and Education)
- ✅ Simple, accurate names - no overselling

#### Component Names
| Old Name | New Name (Nepali) | New Name (English) |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| News Intelligence Dashboard | समाचार विश्लेषण | News Analysis |
| Government Office Tracker | सरकारी सेवा | Government Services |
| Political Education Game | राजनीतिक शिक्षा | Political Education |

#### Color Palette
- **Primary**: Blue-purple gradient (#667eea → #764ba2)
- **News**: Blue (#3b82f6)
- **Government**: Emerald (#10b981)
- **Political**: Purple (#8b5cf6)
- **Background**: Clean white/gray (#f8f9fa)

#### Design Features
- Sticky navigation bar
- Smooth hover animations (translateY, box-shadow)
- Card-based layout
- Stats section (2,000+ articles, 25+ sources, 7 provinces, 100% free)
- Responsive grid layout

---

## 3. BILINGUAL SUPPORT

### Implementation
Created language toggle system with localStorage persistence:

**CSS Classes**:
```css
.lang-ne { display: block; }
.lang-en { display: none; }
body.english .lang-ne { display: none; }
body.english .lang-en { display: block; }
```

**JavaScript**:
```javascript
function toggleLanguage() {
    document.body.classList.toggle('english');
    localStorage.setItem('language', 'en' or 'ne');
}
```

### Features
- Toggle button in navigation
- Remembers preference across pages
- Default: Nepali
- Both languages fully written (not machine-translated)
- Applied to: index.html, about.html

### Language Fixes
- Changed "के छ यहाँ" → "यहाँ के छ" (correct Nepali word order)
- Changed "हाम्रो दृष्टिकोण" → "किन बनायौं" (more conversational/natural)
- Changed "उपकरणहरूको बारेमा" → "यहाँ के छ" (lightweight, natural)

## 4. ABOUT PAGE CONTENT

### Vision Statement
**Nepali**:
> समाचारहरू हेरफेर हुन्छन्। केही समाचार जबरजस्ती हामीलाई देखाइन्छ, केही लुकाइन्छ। आज कुनै नेता भ्रष्टाचारमा पक्राउ पर्छन्, छ महिना पछि आरोप सफा भएको खबर हावामा हराउँछ।
>
> **हामी समाचारलाई कथाको रूपमा ट्र्याक गर्छौं।** एउटा घटना, त्यसको पछि के भयो, अन्तमा के परिणाम आयो - सबै जोडेर देखाउँछौं।

**English**:
> News is often manipulated. Some stories are pushed to us, others are hidden. When a leader is arrested for corruption today, the story of cleared charges six months later disappears into thin air.
>
> **We track news as stories.** One event, what happened next, and the final outcome - all connected.

### Government Services Vision
**Nepali**:
> कुन सरकारी कार्यालय राम्रो छ? कुन नराम्रो? प्रत्येक काममा कति समय लाग्छ? यो मञ्चले समयसँगै कार्यालयहरू राम्रो भइरहेका छन् कि नराम्रो भइरहेका छन् पनि देखाउँछ।

**English**:
> Which government offices work well? Which don't? How long does each task take? This platform tracks office performance over time - showing which offices are improving and which are getting worse.

## 5. DASHBOARD VERSION SYNC

### Issue Discovery
User noticed dashboard was using **old version** with outdated influence scores:
- Old version: Using social_metrics table (Facebook/Twitter data from Sept 15-22)
- New RSS articles: Oct 1-6 with no social metrics
- Result: Influence scores were irrelevant

### File Structure Discovery
```
/Users/muna/Documents/Aryan/aryan_try/
├── nepal_platform_clean/          # ← DEPLOYMENT (was outdated)
├── nepal_working_platform/         # ← LATEST VERSION
└── ratenepal/                      # ← Original working collector
```

### Files Updated
Copied from `nepal_working_platform` to `nepal_platform_clean`:
1. `nepal_dashboard.py` (124K, Oct 5 version)
2. `nepal_news_intelligence.db` (6.8MB, 2,040 articles, Oct 6 data)
3. `enhanced_clustering_preprocessor.py` (already existed but verified)

### What Was Already Fixed in Working Version
- ✅ Enhanced clustering algorithm with angular distance
- ✅ News-specific importance boosting
- ✅ Mixed Nepali-English token processing
- ✅ Temporal decay integration
- ✅ Source diversity penalties
- ✅ Timeline selection bug (weekly view now works)
- ✅ Trending stories using title-based extraction (not TF-IDF stop words)

**Note**: Influence scoring issue **NOT yet fixed** - still relies on social_metrics table

---

## 6. REMAINING ISSUES

### Critical: Influence Score Still Uses Old Data

**Current Implementation** (lines 296-345 in `realtime_analytics_engine.py`):
```python
COALESCE(SUM(s.engagement_score), 0) as total_social_engagement,
COALESCE(AVG(s.engagement_score), 0) as avg_social_engagement
FROM articles_enhanced a
LEFT JOIN social_metrics s ON a.url = s.article_url
```

**Problem**:
- `social_metrics` table has 568 entries from Sept 15-22 only
- New RSS articles (Oct 1-6) have NO entries in social_metrics
- Influence score calculation includes social engagement in formula (line 345)

**Required Fix** (User mentioned this was needed):
Replace social_metrics dependency with RSS-based metrics:
- Article count (number of articles published)
- Quality score (word count, content quality)
- **Cross-source pickup** (how many sources cover same story) ← User specifically requested this
- Publishing speed (first to break story)

**Status**: ⚠️ **NOT YET IMPLEMENTED**

## 8. NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (Blocking)
1. Fix `width='stretch'` error in nepal_dashboard.py (DONE - awaiting deployment)
2. Verify Streamlit Cloud deployment succeeds

### High Priority (User Requested)
1. **Fix influence scoring** to use RSS-based metrics:
   - Remove dependency on social_metrics table
   - Calculate influence from: article count + quality + cross-source pickup + first-to-break
   - User specifically requested: "Cross-source pickup (how many sources cover same story) for score"

2. **Update CLAUDE.md** with:
   - Deployment architecture
   - File structure discovery (working_platform vs platform_clean)
   - Influence scoring issue and solution

### Medium Priority
1. Add language toggle to remaining sections (Tools Detail, Technology, Stats)
2. Set up automated RSS collection (GitHub Actions every 6 hours)
3. Add caching to dashboard for better performance

### Low Priority
1. Mobile responsiveness testing
2. Add more RSS sources
3. Improve word cloud for better Nepali text handling

## 11. LESSONS LEARNED

1. **Always check multiple folders** - Latest code may not be in deployment folder
2. **Document file structure** - Prevents confusion about which version is which
3. **Test locally before deploying** - Caught many issues (width='stretch', missing files)
4. **Netlify requires special handling** - Can't have Python files at root
5. **Language authenticity matters** - Think in Nepali first, don't just translate
6. **User knows the history** - Check existing work before proposing "new" solutions
