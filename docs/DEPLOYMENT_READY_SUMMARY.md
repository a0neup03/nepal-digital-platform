**If this is a new standalone project:**

```bash
cd /Users/muna/Documents/Aryan/aryan_try/nepal_working_platform

# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit - Nepal Digital Intelligence Platform

✅ News Aggregator (2,038 articles, 33 sources)

# Create GitHub repository (via GitHub.com)
# Then connect and push:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/nepal_working_platform.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### **Option 2: Move to Existing ratenepal Repository**

**If you want to consolidate into ratenepal:**

```bash
# Copy automation files to ratenepal
cp -r /Users/muna/Documents/Aryan/aryan_try/nepal_working_platform/.github \
      /Users/muna/Documents/Aryan/aryan_try/ratenepal/

cp /Users/muna/Documents/Aryan/aryan_try/nepal_working_platform/news_aggregator/requirements.txt \
   /Users/muna/Documents/Aryan/aryan_try/ratenepal/nepal_news_aggregator/

# Then commit from ratenepal
cd /Users/muna/Documents/Aryan/aryan_try/ratenepal
git add .github/workflows/collect-news.yml
git add nepal_news_aggregator/requirements.txt
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions automated news collection"
git push origin main
```

### **Option 3: Deploy Later**

**Keep everything local for now:**

```bash
# Use local cron for automated collection
cd /Users/muna/Documents/Aryan/aryan_try/nepal_working_platform/news_aggregator/scripts
./setup_cron.sh

# Files are ready for GitHub when you want to deploy
# No action needed now
```

## 🔄 DUAL SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### **System 1: GitHub Actions (Primary)** 🌐

**Best for:**
- ✅ 24/7 collection without local computer
- ✅ Traveling or computer off
- ✅ Professional reliability
- ✅ Automatic git versioning
- ✅ Shareable/public dashboard data

**Limitations:**
- ⚠️ Requires GitHub repository
- ⚠️ Database grows in git (use Git LFS for large files)
- ⚠️ 15-minute scheduling granularity minimum

**When to use:**
- Daily production use
- When you're away from computer
- For reliable, hands-off operation

### **System 2: Local Cron (Backup)** 💻

**Best for:**
- ✅ Testing new collection strategies
- ✅ Custom scheduling (any minute/hour)
- ✅ Direct database access
- ✅ No internet dependency
- ✅ Faster iterations during development

**Limitations:**
- ⚠️ Computer must be on and awake
- ⚠️ macOS sleep stops cron jobs
- ⚠️ Manual log management

**When to use:**
- Development and testing
- When GitHub Actions is down
- For immediate/custom collections
- Running dashboard locally

---

## 📊 RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW

### **Production Mode** (GitHub Actions active):

```bash
# Morning: GitHub Actions collects news at 6 AM Nepal
# - No action needed
# - Database auto-commits to GitHub

# Midday: GitHub Actions collects at 12 PM Nepal
# - No action needed

# Evening: GitHub Actions collects at 6 PM Nepal
# - No action needed

# When you work:
git pull  # Get latest articles from GitHub
streamlit run news_aggregator/nepal_dashboard.py

# Development/testing:
./news_aggregator/scripts/collect_news.sh --test  # Manual test run
```

### **Development Mode** (Local only):

```bash
# Set up cron once
cd news_aggregator/scripts
./setup_cron.sh

# Cron runs automatically when computer is on
# Manual runs as needed:
./collect_news.sh --test  # Quick test (10 articles)
./collect_news.sh         # Full collection (100 articles)

# Check health
python health_check.py
```

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS (Choose Your Path)

### **Path A: Deploy to GitHub (Recommended)**
1. Initialize git repository (or use existing ratenepal)
2. Create GitHub repository on github.com
3. Push files to GitHub
4. Test workflow manually (Actions → Run workflow)
5. Automated collection starts tomorrow

**Time**: 10 minutes
**Benefit**: 24/7 automated collection

### **Path B: Use Local Cron**
1. Run `./setup_cron.sh`
2. Keep computer on during collection times
3. Check logs in `news_aggregator/logs/`

**Time**: 2 minutes
**Benefit**: Immediate activation

### **Path C: Hybrid Approach**
1. Start with local cron for testing
2. Deploy GitHub Actions when ready
3. Disable local cron after GitHub is working

**Time**: 12 minutes total
**Benefit**: Test locally, then go cloud
